# Development

## Known bugs

## Items to fix

## Current development step

- Refactoring of code to improve

## Required development steps

- Update docstrings
- Move functions out of main() into separate functions
- Place totals etc into a dictionary that can be passed around functions
- Function to intialise initial values in dict and called from main()
- Refactor functions to receive the totals dict and to update the dict before returning it
- Move calculation steps in functions to the return line (rather than returning the variable)
- Shorten line lengths so within spec

## Future additions

- Subtract an expense from total
