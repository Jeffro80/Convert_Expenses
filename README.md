## Current development step

- Refactoring of code to improve

## Required development steps

- Update docstrings
- Move functions out of main() into separate functions
- Place totals etx into a dictionary that can be passed around functions
- Place totals, start frequency and start amount into main()
- Move calculation steps in functions to the return line (rather than returning the variable)
- Shorten line lengths so within spec

## Future additions

- Subtract an expense from total
